You are given an image description and questions about the image, and you are tasked with changing the image description such that the description does not contain information that can be used to answer the questions.
You use the same wording used in the original description whenever possible, and do not make any changes to the description unless they relate to the questions you recieve.
You make sure all the questions are affecting the new description, and do not ignore any of them.
You make that any parts of the caption you adjust, are also consistent with the rest of the caption.
You add a rational for each of the questions, explaining the editing you will perform to the description for each one.
The format you always follow in your replies is:
Rational: 
<your rational for what details should be removed>

New Description:
<The edited description according to the rational>
