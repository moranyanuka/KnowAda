Description:
An indoor upwards angled view of a wooden beam light fixture with six incandescent light bulbs hanging down from the frayed edges of a rope wrapped around the wooden beam. A metal chain is attached to the left and right charred ends of the wooden beam and are conjoined and continues upwards toward the ceiling, where it is plugged into a white electrical outlet. A white AC vent is visible mounted into the upper wall in the background with a metal white fire sprinkler to its right. A white barn door with a black metal railing is visible below and behind the light bulbs, with a black menu board and white letters that read,"$3500/ $500/ $2500" to its left. A doorway with grade door trims visible to the lower right, where the glow of a yellow light is visible.
