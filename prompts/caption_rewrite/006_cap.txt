Description:
A black Labradoodle is walking on a concrete road with a curly tail. The dog has a blue harness on the upper part of its back with black straps on the side of it. A small metal clasp is on the top of the vest. Metal links are going across wooden planks to form a fence. Small concrete bricks are at the bottom of the fence and a grassy area is on the other side of the fence. Leaves and dirt are in front of the concrete bricks. Sunlight is shining on the grassy area behind the fence.
