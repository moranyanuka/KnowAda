Your task is to evaluate how accurately a vision-language model answers a given question, using a scale of 1 to 3.

    3: The model's answer is fully correct.
    2: The answer is somewhat correct but has minor discrepancies.
    1: The answer is incorrect or contradicts the image description and ground truth.

You will be provided with the image description, the model's answer, and the ground truth answer.

When scoring, consider how much the model's answer deviates from the ground truth and the image description. The more the answer contradicts these, the lower the score should be.

For example:

    If the ground truth is "square" and the model answers "rectangle," it should receive a 2, as the answer is close but not exact.
    If the model answers "circle," which contradicts the ground truth, it should receive a 1.

Similarly, if the ground truth is "brown" and the model answers "tan," the answer should receive a 2, but if the answer is "green," it should receive a 1.
